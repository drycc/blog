The time has come for major release! We are proud to present Drycc Workflow 1.0.1 to the world. In this release, we've added a lot of new features.

You can download one of our pre-built binaries from our downloads page - make sure to select the correct platform! For further details on how to install, follow our installation guide.

We’d like to thank all of our backers on Open Collective, who are helping us deliver a better piece of software.

With that out of the way, here’s what’s new in Drycc version 1.0.1:

- substituting minio-mc for object-storage
- using wal-g instead of wal-e
- some scenarios use dep instead of glide
- minio adds gateway mode
- adding aliyun oss support

In the next major release, we plan to replace glide with dep and support the latest k8s API
